# Exploratory Data Analysis

## What is data exploration?
Data exploration, also known as exploratory data analysis (EDA), is the process of analyzing a dataset to understand its characteristics and patterns. It's the first step in data analysis and helps prepare for in-depth analysis.

## What does data exploration involve?
Visually exploring the data to identify patterns, outliers, and relationships 
Applying statistical methods to understand quality, range, and scale 
Determining the data types, formats, and structures 
Finding missing values
Identifying inconsistencies that could lead to inaccurate analysis 
Highlighting outliers
Using descriptive statistics to summarize the data

## Data Exploration Methods
- Descriptive Statistics/Boxplots
- Histograms
- Scatter plots
- Correlation coefficients
- See the [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html) gallery for other interesting exploration visuals

## Spearman Correlation
- Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficient is a measure of the extent to which two variables are monotonically increasing or decreasing together.
- It is bound between -1 (decreasing) and +1 (increasing), with 0 meaning the two variables are uncorrelated.
- Spearman can be informative for non-linear data.
- Read the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient) page for a quick overview
