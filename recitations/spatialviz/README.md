# Geospatial Visualization

## Introduction
Geospatial visualization allows us to create maps and understand the spatial context of our data in a way that is not immediately understood via tables. Geospatial visualization can help people understand complex patterns, relationships, and trends. It's used in many fields, including: transportation, urban planning, agriculture, environmental monitoring, and emergency management. There are many different types of maps, but we will cover chloropleth maps here.

## Choropleth Maps
Choropleth maps aggregated variables (e.g., median income, average temperature) across discrete spatial units (e.g., census tracts, counties, neighborhoods, districts, countries, etc.). Data should be normalized (e.g., rates, proportions, percentages) to make different regions comparable. Choropleth maps can contain one or more variables. For bivariate choropleth maps, we bin the variable using quantiles.
