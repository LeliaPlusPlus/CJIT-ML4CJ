# Leveraging Machine Learning to Advance Climate Justice
This repository contains curriculum for the computing module in the Climate Justice Instructional Toolkit by the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative. We piloted this curriculum during MIT IAP 2025.

This module provides a curriculum that integrates climate justice and machine learning for practical real-world applications. Part 1 explores why ML is useful to advance CJ, ethical considerations, and sociotechnical frameworks. Part 2 discusses how to move from data to impact. Part 3 explores urban heat disparities as a case study for interpretable ML applications. Parts 4 and 5 explore climate health equity in heat-related illness.

The intended learning goals of the curriculum are
1. Understand why ML is useful to study climate justice, social justice frameworks for applied ML, and the ethical implications.
2. Learn how to leverage machine learning to quantify and address societal disparities in climate change related outcomes.
3. Gain deeper insights into climate justice patterns through machine learning interpretability techniques.
4. Construct a project with an external climate justice related dataset that considers context.
