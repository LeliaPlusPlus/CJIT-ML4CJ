# Leveraging Machine Learning to Advance Climate Justice

## Course Information
Location: Virtual  
Lecture Time: 12-1:30 PM  
Dates: January 7-30, 2025 (MIT IAP 2025)

## Instructor
Lelia Marie Hampton  
Ph.D. Student, EECS/AI+D  
lelia@mit.edu  
Course Supervisor: Christopher Rabe (cjrabe@mit.edu)

## Prerequisites
A passion for climate justice and social justice. Python skills. Knowledge of basic data exploration (i.e., correlation analysis, kernel density estimation). Knowledge of logistic regression and tree methods (e.g., random forest, XGBoost) is optional, but helpful. 

## Course Description
How can we use machine learning to advance climate justice? In this course, we engage students in leveraging their data science skillset to study climate justice issues. Students read papers to understand ongoing humanistic and data-driven research in climate justice topics. Students work through case studies of disparities in urban heat islands and heat-related illness through several problem sets. Throughout the course, the students will simultaneously engage with machine learning ethics and climate justice issues. Students reflect on their motivations for pursuing climate justice through a machine learning lens, the potential limitations of machine learning to study climate justice issues, and the role civic engagement can play in this realm. 

## Intended Learning Outcomes
1. Learn about climate justice concepts and principles.
2. Understand the emerging literature on quantitative studies of climate justice.
3. Understand the strengths and limitations of a quantitative, or machine learning, approach to studying climate justice.
4. Connect equity issues in machine learning to equity issues in climate change.
5. Understand how to translate research output into climate justice advocacy.

## Materials and Resources
All materials and resources will be made publicly available through open source mechanisms. All readings are publicly available. The homework materials will be accessible to the public as well. 

## Lecture Structure
Each lecture will provide background information on a given topic during the first half. A quantitative and qualitative reading is required for each lecture in order to strengthen students as data scientists and change agents simultaneously. Students will read and submit reflections weekly; they will reflect on the readings in a respectful group discussion during the second half of lecture.
