# Problem Sets

Each discipline-specific module in the Climate Justice Instructional Toolkit consists of at least 3 problem sets. 

In this module:
- Problem Set 1 engages students in leveraging interpretable tree-based machine learning to explain how environmental factors influence disparities in urban heat.
- Problem Set 2 demonstrates how to leverage a logistic regression model to understand which groups are most impacted by property flood risk.
- Problem Set 3 shows how to recognize patterns in the CDC Heat and Health Index with clustering.  

The skeleton code for the problem sets can be adjusted for a course or used off the shelf.
